## üïò | Changelog

**v1.0.18**
- Fixed typing bug in all methods requiring to specify a value.

**v1.0.17**
- Fixed typo in type name.

**v1.0.16**
- Added the `IsUsingDatabaseProperties` generic type that defaults to `false` into main `Mongo` class to determine if `DatabaseProperties object will be returned in all database methods.
- Typings improvements.

**v1.0.15**
- Added the `K` generic type into main `Mongo` class that represents the type of database keys.
- Typings bugfixes & improvements.

**v1.0.14**
- Fixed the incorrect import paths in `MongoItems` files.

**v1.0.13**
- Changed the way how all files are exported. (keeping QuickMongo exported as it is for legacy reasons)
- Improved configurations.
- Improved code linting & code quality.
- Deleted unnecessary files to reduce the package size.
- Added an optional type parameter to the main `Mongo` class that will be used in all methods that are returning the `DatabaseProperties` object.
- Added a type parameter to the `Emitter` class that will determine what type will be used to get the event names and their return types from.
- Added a new `MongoItems.js` file that contains all the module's **types**, and **classes**.
- Added a new `MongoItems.d.ts` file that contains all the module's **types**, **interfaces** and **classes**.

**v1.0.12**
- Bug fixes.

**v1.0.11**
- Fixed the empty key error when trying to clear the database - now the `key` parameter in `keysList()` method is optional and defaults to empty string (`''`) if not specified.
- Changed the ESLint configuration and linted the code to make it look prettier.
- Added the `I` prefix to all interface names (e.g. `MongoConnectionOptions` => `IMongoConnectionOptions`). Keeping the `DatabaseProperties` interface without the `I` prefix for legacy reasons.
- Removed the `./src/` and `./examples/` directories from publishing on NPM to reduce the package size. These folders will still be available in module's GitHub repository. From now, only compiled version of the module (`./dist/`) and typings (`./typings`) folders are going to be published on NPM.
- Removed `./typings` directory from pushing in the repository as the folder unnecessary in the repository.
- Added a type parameters description in each generic method's description.
- Fixed JSDoc **parameter types**/**return types** and **descriptions** mismatches.
- Fixed linting issues in example scripts.
- Fixed minor bugs.
- Added an option for `package.json` to disable the post-install greeting logs. To disable them, you need to add this in your `package.json`:
```json
"quick-mongo-super": {
    "postinstall": false
}
```
To enable them back, you need to set the `"postinstall"` property of `"quick-mongo-super"` object to `true`:
```json
"quick-mongo-super": {
    "postinstall": true
}
```

- - `subtract()`
- - `push()`
- - `pop()`
- - `removeElement()`
- - `pull()`
- - `changeElement()`
- methods in a main class.
- `all()`, `raw()` and all the methods above have received a new `P` type parameter to use them in `DatabaseProperties` and `DatabaseObject` interfaces.

- Fixed bugs on connection errors.

**v1.0.7**
