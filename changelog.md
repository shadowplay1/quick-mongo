## üïò | Changelog

**v1.0.11**
- Fixed the empty key error when trying to clear the database - now the `key` parameter in `keysList()` method is optional and defaults to empty string (`''`) if not specified.
- Changed the ESLint configuration and linted the code to make it look prettier.
- Added the `I` prefix to all interface names (e.g. `MongoConnectionOptions` => `IMongoConnectionOptions`). Keeping the `DatabaseProperties` interface without the `I` prefix for legacy reasons.
- Removed the `./src/` and `./examples/` directories from publishing on NPM to reduce the package size. These folders will still be available in module's GitHub repository. From now, only compiled version of the module (`./dist/`) and typings (`./typings`) folders are going to be published on NPM.
- Removed `./typings` directory from pushing in the repository as the folder unnecessary in the repository.
- Added a type parameters description in each generic method's description.
- Fixed JSDoc **parameter types**/**return types** and **descriptions** mismatches.
- Fixed linting issues in example scripts.
- Fixed minor bugs.
- Added an option for `package.json` to disable the post-install greeting logs. To disable them, you need to add this in your `package.json`:
```json
"quick-mongo-super": {
    "postinstall": false
}
```
To enable them back, you need to set the `"postinstall"` property of `"quick-mongo-super"` object to `true`:
```json
"quick-mongo-super": {
    "postinstall": true
}
```
